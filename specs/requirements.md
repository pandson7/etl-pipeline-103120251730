# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS Glue that processes parquet files, transforms them to JSON format, and stores metadata in DynamoDB. The system will handle taxi trip data files and provide comprehensive data processing capabilities with metadata tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Ingestion
**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to ingest parquet files from a source location, so that I can process taxi trip data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a parquet file is placed in the source S3 bucket THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically detect and queue it for processing
2. WHEN the system processes a parquet file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file format and structure
3. WHEN an invalid parquet file is detected THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and skip processing
4. WHEN a file is successfully ingested THE SYSTEM SHALL record the ingestion timestamp and file metadata

### Requirement 2: Data Transformation
**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to transform parquet data to JSON format, so that downstream systems can consume the data in a standardized format.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a parquet file is processed THE SYSTEM SHALL convert each record to JSON format
2. WHEN transforming data THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve all original field names and data types
3. WHEN transformation is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the JSON output structure
4. WHEN transformation fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log detailed error information and halt processing for that file

### Requirement 3: Metadata Storage
**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to store processing metadata in DynamoDB, so that I can track file processing status and history.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a file processing starts THE SYSTEM SHALL create a metadata record with processing status "IN_PROGRESS"
2. WHEN file processing completes successfully THE SYSTEM SHALL update the metadata record with status "COMPLETED" and processing statistics
3. WHEN file processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL update the metadata record with status "FAILED" and error details
4. WHEN querying metadata THE SYSTEM SHALL return processing history, file information, and current status

### Requirement 4: Output Storage
**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want processed JSON data stored in S3, so that downstream applications can access the transformed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data transformation is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL store JSON files in the designated output S3 bucket
2. WHEN storing output files THE SYSTEM SHALL organize files by processing date and source file name
3. WHEN output storage is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL update the metadata record with output location
4. WHEN storage fails THE SYSTEM SHALL retry up to 3 times before marking the job as failed

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Monitoring
**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve processing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any processing error occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
2. WHEN a job fails THE SYSTEM SHALL send notifications to the monitoring system
3. WHEN processing is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL log success metrics and processing duration
4. WHEN the system encounters resource constraints THE SYSTEM SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Testing
**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to test the entire pipeline with sample data, so that I can verify the system works correctly before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN running end-to-end tests THE SYSTEM SHALL process the sample yellow_tripdata_2021-01.parquet file successfully
2. WHEN testing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL verify that JSON output matches expected format and content
3. WHEN testing metadata storage THE SYSTEM SHALL confirm all metadata records are created and updated correctly
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THE SYSTEM SHALL handle invalid inputs gracefully and log appropriate errors
